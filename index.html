      <p> iPads are similar to phones. You can do pretty much everything you can do on a phone but an iPad is just bigger.
          iPads are made by the company called Apple.

        <p> My favorite type of technology is laptops because I think they are big and portable which is useful. I also like them 
            because they can still run games and have many features. I also like that I can type because I am really good at typing.
